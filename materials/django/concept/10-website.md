# Create website using Django
Creating a website like Facebook.com using Django would be a complex and challenging task that would require a team of experienced developers and a significant amount of time and resources. However, here's a brief overview of the key steps involved in building some of Facebook.com's core features using Django:

### 1. Users:
- Pages: To allow users to create pages on the website, the developer would need to define a "Page" model in Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. This model would store information about the page, such as its name, description, and category. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to create, edit, and view pages on the site.
- Photos: To allow users to upload and view photos, the developer would need to create a "Photo" model in Django's ORM system. This model would store information about the photo, such as its title, caption, and image file. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to upload and view photos on the site.
- Friends: To allow users to connect with each other and become friends on the site, the developer would need to create a "Friendship" model in Django's ORM system. This model would store information about the friendship, such as the two users involved and the date the friendship was formed. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to send friend requests, accept friend requests, and view their list of friends.

### 2. Feed:
- Likes: To allow users to like posts and photos in their feed, the developer would need to create a "Like" model in Django's ORM system. This model would store information about the like, such as the user who liked the post, the post they liked, and the date the like was made. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to like and unlike posts and photos.
- Comments: To allow users to comment on posts and photos in their feed, the developer would need to create a "Comment" model in Django's ORM system. This model would store information about the comment, such as the user who made the comment, the post or photo they commented on, and the text of the comment. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to create and view comments on posts and photos.

### 3. Groups:
- Members: To allow users to create and join groups on the site, the developer would need to create a "Group" model in Django's ORM system. This model would store information about the group, such as its name, description, and category. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to create, edit, and view groups on the site, as well as a "Membership" model to track which users are members of each group.
- Messages: To allow users to send messages to each other within groups, the developer would need to create a "Message" model in Django's ORM system. This model would store information about the message, such as the user who sent the message, the group the message was sent to, and the text of the message. The developer would also need to create views and templates to allow users to send and view messages within groups.

Overall, building a website like Facebook.com using Django would require a combination of technical skills, design expertise, and project management experience. It would also require a deep understanding of the site's core features and functionality, as well as the ability to adapt to changing user needs and trends.

# Static files
In Django, static files are used to serve files that do not change during the lifetime of a web application. Examples of static files include stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images. These files are served directly from the web server, without being processed by Django.

To serve static files in Django, you need to create a `static` directory in your application. Inside this directory, you can create subdirectories to organize your static files, such as `styles` for CSS files, `js` for JavaScript files, and `images` for image files.

Here is an example directory structure for static files in a Django project:

```
myproject/
|-- myproject/
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- wsgi.py
|-- myapp/
|   |-- templates/
|   |-- static/
|       |-- styles/
|           |-- main.css
|           |-- profile.css
|       |-- js/
|           |-- script.js
|           |-- profile.js
|       |-- images/
|           |-- logo.png
|-- manage.py
```

To use static files in your templates, you need to add the `{% load static %}` template tag at the top of your template. You can then reference your static files using the `{% static %}` template tag, like this:

```html
{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'styles/main.css' %}">
<script src="{% static 'js/script.js' %}"></script>
<img src="{% static 'images/logo.png' %}" alt="Logo">
```

In addition to serving static files during development, you also need to configure your web server to serve static files in production. Django provides a `collectstatic` management command that collects all static files from your project and copies them to a single directory that can be served by your web server.

# Key features
Django is a high-level, open-source web framework for Python that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is designed to make web development faster, easier, and more secure by providing developers with a set of tools and features to build complex web applications.

### 1. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
Django provides an ORM that allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects instead of SQL statements. This makes it easier to work with databases and reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.

### 2. Admin Interface
Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows developers to manage the data in the application without writing any code. It includes features such as CRUD operations, search, filtering, and sorting.

### 3. URL Routing
Django provides a URL routing system that allows developers to map URLs to views. This makes it easier to create SEO-friendly URLs and handle complex URL patterns.

### 4. Templating Engine
Django provides a built-in templating engine that allows developers to create dynamic web pages by separating the presentation logic from the business logic.

### 5. Security
Django provides built-in security features such as cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, and password hashing.

### 6. Scalability
Django is designed to be scalable and can handle high traffic websites. It provides caching and session management features to improve performance.

### 7. Third-party Libraries
Django has a large and active community of developers who have created a wide range of third-party libraries and packages that extend its functionality.

Overall, Django is a powerful and flexible web framework that can be used to build a wide range of web applications, from simple websites to complex enterprise applications. Its ease of use, security features, and scalability make it a popular choice for web developers.

# Install Django
Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage third-party Python packages. To install Django, a popular Python web framework, you can use pip by running the command `pip install django` in a terminal or command prompt. This will download and install the latest version of Django and its dependencies on your system. Once the installation is complete, you can start using Django to build web applications by creating a new Django project and running the development server. Overall, pip is a powerful tool that makes it easy to install and manage Python packages, including Django and many others, and is a must-have for any Python developer.

## Install pip
To install pip on your computer, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Run the following command to download the `get-pip.py` script:

   ```python
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   ```

3. Once the download is complete, run the following command to install pip:
   ```python
   python3 get-pip.py
   ```

4. Wait for the installation to complete. Once the installation is finished, pip should be installed on your computer.

5. You can verify that pip is installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
   ```python
   pip --version
   ```

   This should display the version of pip you have installed on your computer.

> Note: If you are using a version of Python earlier than Python 3.4, pip may not be included with your Python installation. In this case, you can download the `get-pip.py` script and run it using your Python interpreter (e.g. `python get-pip.py` for Python 2).

## Install Django using pip
To install Django using pip, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Run the following command to install Django using pip:
   ```python
   pip install django
   ```

3. Wait for the installation to complete. Once the installation is finished, Django should be installed on your computer.

4. You can verify that Django is installed by opening a Python shell and running the following command:
   ```python
   import django
   print(django.get_version())
   ```

   This should print the version of Django that you have installed on your computer.

> Note: Depending on your system configuration, you may need to run pip with administrative privileges (e.g. using `sudo pip install django` on Linux or macOS) or use a virtual environment to install Django.

<h2>Design Choices</h2>

The application is a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout by creating an order. The design of the application is straightforward and built on top of the Django framework.

The main data models used in the application are Category, Product, Order, and OrderItem. Category and Product are used to organize the products in the database, while Order and OrderItem are used to manage the checkout process.

The application is designed to be easy to use and navigate, with a simple, responsive interface that allows users to quickly find what they are looking for. The UI is built with HTML templates, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

- The system assumes that all products are priced the same regardless of quantity or any other factors, as there is no option to set different prices for different quantities or offer discounts or promotions.
- The system assumes there is only one seller in the system. 
- The system assumes that all products are available for purchase at all times, and there is no option to indicate if a product is out of stock or temporarily unavailable.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

- The implementation may not be optimized for large-scale applications, as it has not been tested with very large datasets.
- The implementation may have security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks, if not used and configured properly.
- The implementation assumes that the database schema is already created and will not handle schema changes automatically. Manual intervention may be required to handle schema changes.
- The implementation may have performance issues if the database is not properly indexed.
- The implementation does not integrate with payment gateway.

<h2>System Interface</h2>
<h4>Public Access</h4>
  
1. Home Page

When users access the website, they will be directed to the home page which is the list of products. However, to make a purchase, they must log in first.

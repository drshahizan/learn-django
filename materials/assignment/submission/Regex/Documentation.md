<h2>Introduction</h2>
The e-commerce industry has transformed the way we buy and sell products and services. Customers can now shop online, browse through numerous products, and purchase them from the comfort of their homes. We will explore developing an e-commerce platform using the Django framework, which is a versatile Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Django simplifies the development process by providing built-in features and tools, and we will leverage these features to create a user-friendly and responsive e-commerce website.

Our platform will have a straightforward design that focuses on ease of use and functionality. It will consist of several key components, including Category, Product, Order, and OrderItem models that will allow us to organize products into different categories, manage customer orders, and track order items. Customers will have an intuitive and responsive user interface to ensure a seamless shopping experience. They will be able to view product listings, search for specific items, add products to their shopping cart, and make modifications before proceeding to the checkout process. The platform will also collect shipping and billing details for smooth order fulfillment.

Administrators will have a comprehensive dashboard that will display vital information such as product listings, categories, orders, and total sales. They will have the ability to create, modify, and remove categories and products, as well as view and modify order statuses. This level of control ensures efficient management of the e-commerce platform and enables administrators to provide excellent customer service.

It's essential to note that our e-commerce platform may not be optimized for large-scale applications and may have security and performance considerations that need to be addressed for real-world deployment. Nonetheless, this project will provide a solid foundation for understanding the development of e-commerce platforms using Django and serve as a starting point for future enhancements and improvements.

In brief, our e-commerce platform using Django will showcase the power and flexibility of this popular web framework. By leveraging Django's features and following best practices, we aim to create a user-friendly and responsive e-commerce website that allows customers to browse, search, and purchase products effortlessly while providing administrators with the necessary tools to manage and monitor the platform effectively.

<h2>Design Choices</h2>

This e-commerce website is a user-friendly platform that enables users to explore a wide range of products, add them to their cart, and effortlessly complete their checkout process by placing an order. The application is built on top of the reliable Django framework and has a simple yet efficient design.

The primary data models utilized in this application are Category, Product, Order, and OrderItem. Category and Product are used to systematically organize the products in the database, while Order and OrderItem are responsible for managing the checkout process.

The application's interface is designed to be smooth and hassle-free, catering to users' convenience. The UI is crafted using HTML templates, CSS, and JavaScript and has a responsive design that allows for easy navigation and quick access to the desired products.

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

- The system assumes that products are priced uniformly, irrespective of the quantity or any other factors. It does not allow sellers to offer discounts or promotions on different quantities.
- The system assumes there is only one seller in the system. 
- The system assumes that all products are available for purchase at all times, and there is no option to indicate if a product is out of stock or temporarily unavailable.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

- The implementation may not be optimized for large-scale applications, as it has not been tested with high volumes datasets.
- The implementation may have security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks, if not used and configured properly.
- The implementation assumes that the database schema is already created and will not handle schema changes automatically. Manual intervention may be required to handle schema changes.
- The implementation may have performance issues if the database is not properly indexed.
- The implementation does not integrate with the payment gateway.

<h2>System Interface</h2>

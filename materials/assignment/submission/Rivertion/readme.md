  <p>A Student Information System (SIS) developed using Django is a web-based application that helps educational institutions efficiently manage student-related data. Built on the Django framework, the SIS provides features such as student profile management, enrollment and course management, attendance tracking, and communication/notification capabilities. By leveraging Django's capabilities, the SIS streamlines administrative tasks, improves data management, and enhances communication within the educational institution.</p>

<h2>Design Choices</h2>

Our team was tasked with creating a blogging platform using Django. Users should be able to manage their own postings, make and publish blog entries, and leave comments on other people's writings on the platform. The most popular content and overall blog activity could be shown on the admin dashboard. Django was selected as the project's framework because it is an established framework that is ideal for creating online applications. Data for the project will be kept in a SQLite database. For tiny applications, SQLite is the ideal database because it is compact and simple to use. The application's primary data models are Profile and BlogModel. When building user profiles and blog entries, these models can conduct Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) activities. The project's user interface will be styled using the Bootstrap CSS framework. A responsive and mobile-friendly user interface can be easily made using the well-liked and documented Bootstrap framework.





<h2>Assumptions</h2>
A few common assumptions that are implemented while developing the blogging system:
<ul>

   <li>The platform assumes that it is governed only by the Administrator (Admin user). </li>

   <li>The platform assumes that everyone that visits the blogging platform can make and publish blog entries, as well as comment on otherâ€™s posts </li>

   <li>The platform assumes that the general public are well aware of the procedures in creating and managing their blog posts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
A few limitations that are faced while developing the blogging system are:
<ul>

   <li> Designing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface was a bit challenging. Balancing functionality with simplicity, creating intuitive navigation, and           optimizing the user experience across different devices and screen sizes can present difficulties..</li>

   <li>Limited time for the development of blogging system </li>

   <li>Development was a little bit limited by technical constraints which impacted the performance and scalability of the blogging system..</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
There are several other features that might be added to the project in addition to the core ones of the Django blogging platform. These characteristics could include:
<ul>
<li>The capability of labeling blog content using categories and tags.</li>
<li>The capability of comment moderation.</li>
<li>The capacity to follow blog entries.</li>
<li>Being able to monitor blog traffic.</li>
</ul>
The Django blogging platform would become a more potent and adaptable tool for users with the addition of these new functionalities.


<h2>System Interface</h2>
<h4>**Public Access**</h4>

1. Landing Page
Users will be led to the landing page when they visit the website.  A landing page is a standalone web page designed to entice a specific audience to take action. Users can view older or newer content uploaded by other authors on this page. In addition, they are permitted to write their own blog post too.

</p>
<br></br>

3. CRUD Operation with Blog Posts
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic actions that a software application should be able to do.Users must be able to make blogposts, access data in the UI by reading or viewing the posts, update or amend the posts, and remove the posts in our blogging platform.

<br></br>

When the image is uploaded successfully, we are able to see the name of the chosen file. To create a blog, proceed to click on the **'Create Blog'** buttonn.

<h4>**Admin**</h4>

1. Admin Page
This is the initial page for administrators. Here we can log in as an administrator with the following details:
- Username: admin
- Password: 123123

</p>
<br></br>

2. Admin Dashboard
Once logged in, admins can view blog's recent activity. They can also view the blog models posted by the general public.

</p>
<br></br>

3. Log Out
After managing the blog, admins are required to log out from their site to ensure security of the blog isn't breached. Admins are also allowed to govern their own profile by changing their password.
